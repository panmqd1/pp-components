# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

name: CI

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  # This workflow contains a single job called "build"
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1 将代码仓库的内容拉取到工作目录中
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # 2 安装Node, 并设置版本为18
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: 18

      # 3 安装依赖
      - run: npm run clean:cache
      
      # 4 构建项目
      - run: npm run build
      
      # 5 上传构建产物 (actions/upload-artifact@v3 会上传工作流程中的文件, 允许您在作业之间共享数据并在工作流程完成后存储数据)
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v2
        with:
          path: "./dist"

      # 6 部署 Github Pages
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v2
        with:
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
